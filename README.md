This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



In Progress: using bootstrap Album/Carousel template to model some styling

## Code Coverage Badge

![Coverage](badges/coverage.svg)


This repository automatically generates and updates a local code coverage badge every time you push to `master` or `main`.

**Setup is automatic!**

**Badge (add this to your README):**

```markdown
![Coverage](badges/coverage.svg)
```

When your CI workflow runs, the badge will be updated with the current test coverage automatically.

### How It Works
- Test coverage report is generated by Jest (`npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false`).
- A badge SVG is generated using [`coverage-badges-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coverage-badges-cli) into the `badges/` folder in your repo.
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/coverage-badge.yml`) will automatically commit and push the updated badge.
- No 3rd party service or badge hosting is required â€” everything is inside your repo!
