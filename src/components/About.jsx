        <div className="border border-primary rounted">Project freight experience - Chad oversaw, priced and handled the entire Flying Dog Brewery move from Colorado to Maryland.  We worked with Flying Dog management to price up several potential site locations strategically looking at sales numbers and what made sense from a logistics perspective.  We contracted crane services for the pickup and delivery and arranged 11 flatbed shipments that included 3 oversized shipments requiring travel escorts and permitting.   All went well and the brewery was back up and running two weeks later in the process.  Our experience in handling such specialized freight created a savings in down time and was cost effective in coordination with the costly crane services that we were able to minimize through our preparedness.

        <div className="border border-primary rounted">Warehouse partner services  - When RES - Renewable Energy Systems was installing a project in southern California, everything was going well until the government services created a delay with permitting of the final install.  The 40 ocean containers were already set to land in Long Beach and the demurrage cost was going to be in the thousands of dollars, RES came to Chad asking for a solution.  We established a partnership for drayage and warehouse storage of the freight and do a full inventory receiving of the 400+ solar panels for future delivery later in the summer.  Our solution again saved the client money and established a streamline of the deliveries when the facility was ready to proceed.
